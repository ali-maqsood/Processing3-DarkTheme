## How to Install
  1. Search for preferences.txt and theme.txt on your computer, theme.txt is usually placed in apps installation 
     directory lib/theme.txt and preferences.txt on my computer/linux was found under ~.processing/preferences.txt
     I have no idea about their location on Windows and Mac OS, If you can't find them Google their location for your OS
  2. **Important!** Make backup of both files.
  3. Replace these files with mine.
  4. Restart IDE and Enjoy! \:)
  5. If you are wondering, I am using Monaco font. If you dont have it, just google it , download it and install it \:)
